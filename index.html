        <h2 class="headings">Overview</h3>
        <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun in the Solar System and the second-smallest planet. Mars is a terrestrial planet with polar ice caps of frozen water and carbon dioxide. It has the largest volcano in the Solar System, and some very large impact craters. Mars is named after the mythological Roman god of war because it appears of red color.
           Space probes such as the Viking program landers are the main tools for the exploration of Mars.</p>

        <h2 class="headings">Appearance</h2>
        <p>Mars is a terrestrial planet and made of rock. The ground there is red because of iron oxide (rust) in the rocks and dust. The planet's atmosphere is very thin. It is mostly carbon dioxide with some argon and nitrogen and tiny amounts of other gases including oxygen. The temperatures on Mars are colder than on Earth, because it is farther away from the Sun and has less air to keep heat in. There is water ice and frozen carbon dioxide at the north and south poles. Mars does not have any liquid water on the surface now, but signs of run-off on the surface were probably caused by water.

            The average thickness of the planet's crust is about 50 km (31 mi), with a maximum thickness of 125 km (78 mi).</p>

        <h2 class="headings">Moons</h2>
        <p>Mars has two small moons, called Phobos and Deimos.


            The moons of Mars: Phobos and Deimos. Phobos is the larger of the two moons, and is the closest of the two to Mars. Phobos has an average radius of 11 km, while Deimos has an average radius of 6 km.
            The origin of Mars' moons is unknown and controversial. One theory is that the moons are captured asteroids. However, the moons' near circular orbits and low inclination relative to the Martian equator are not in agreement with the capture hypothesis. 
            
            Estimates of the mass ejected by a large Borealis-size impact vary. Simulations suggest that a body about 0.02 of Mars mass (~0.002 Earth mass) in size can produce a sizable debris disk in Martian orbit. Much of the material would stay close to Mars. There are several other large impact basins on Mars that could also have ejected enough debris to form the moons.</p>

        <h2 class="headings">Physical Geography</h2>
        <u><h3 class="headings">Lack of Magnetic Field:</h3></u>
        <p> 
            Mars does not have a global magnetic field. Despite this, observations show that parts of the planet's crust have been magnetized. This suggests that polarity reversals have occurred in the past. This paleomagnetism is similar to the magnetic striping found on Earth's ocean floors. One theory is that these bands suggest plate tectonic activity on Mars four billion years ago, before the planetary dynamo stopped working and the planet's magnetic field faded.

        <u><h3 class="headings">Rotation</h3></u>
        <p>A Martian day is called a sol, and is a little longer than an Earth day. Mars rotates in 24 hours and 37 minutes. It rotates on a tilted axis, just like the Earth does, so it has four different seasons. Of all the planets in the Solar System, the seasons of Mars are the most Earth-like, due to their similar axial tilt. The lengths of the Martian seasons are almost twice those of Earth's, as Mars's greater distance from the Sun leads to the Martian year being almost two Earth years long.

            Martian surface temperatures vary from lows of about −143 °C (−225 °F) (at the winter polar caps) to highs of up to 35 °C (95 °F) (in equatorial summer). The wide range in temperatures is due mostly to the thin atmosphere which cannot store much solar heat. The planet is also 1.52 times as far from the Sun as Earth, resulting in just 43% of the amount of sunlight.</p> <hr>
        <u><h3 class="headings">Water</h3></u> 
        <p>A 2015 report says Martian dark streaks on the surface were affected by water. 

            Liquid water cannot exist on the surface of Mars due to its low atmospheric pressure (there's not enough air to hold it in),[13] except at the lowest elevations for short periods.[14] The two polar ice caps appear to be made largely of frozen water. The amount of ice in the south polar ice cap, if melted, would be enough to cover the entire planet's surface 11 meters deep.[6] A permafrost mantle stretches from the pole to latitudes of about 60°.
            
            Geological evidence gathered by unmanned missions suggest that Mars once had much liquid water on its surface.[16] In 2005, radar data revealed the presence of large quantities of water ice at the poles,[17] and at mid-latitudes. The Mars rover Spirit sampled chemical compounds containing water molecules in March 2007. The Phoenix lander found water ice in shallow Martian soil in July 2008.[18] Landforms seen on Mars strongly suggest that liquid water at some time existed on the planet's surface. Huge areas of ground have been scraped and eroded.</p> <hr>
        <u><h3 class="headings">Polar Caps</h3></u> 
        <p>Mars has two permanent polar ice caps. During a pole's winter, it lies in continuous darkness, chilling the surface and causing the deposition of 25–30% of the atmosphere into slabs of CO2 ice (dry ice). When the poles are again exposed to sunlight, the frozen CO2 sublimes (turns to vapor), creating enormous winds that sweep off the poles as fast as 400 km/h. Each season this moves large amounts of dust and water vapor, giving rise to Earth-like frost and large cirrus clouds and dust storms. Clouds of water-ice were photographed by the Opportunity rover in 2004.

            The polar caps at both poles consist primarily of water ice. </p>
